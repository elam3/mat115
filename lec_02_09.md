## Startig Off

**Example:** In a survey of 100 students, 

it is found that 75 own steroes,

45 own cars, and 35 own steroes and cars.

How many own neither a stereo or a car?

> use a venn diagram


**Example:** Supose A = {1,2,3,4}, and B={1,2}

(a) How many proper subsets does A have?

2^4 - 1 = 15

(b) How many subsets of A are `disjoint` from B?

2^2 = 4

(c) How many subsets of A are incomparable with B?

> two sets A and B are `comparable` if Ac=B or Bc=A

> we want to leave off 0, {1}, {2}, {1,2}

> leave off anything that conatins b, {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,2,3,4}

2^4 -7 = 9

**Example:** Let S = {a,b,c}

How many ways are there to `partition` S?

> {a}, {b}, {c}

> {a,b}, {c}

> {a,c}, {b}

> {b,c}, {a}

> {a,b,c}

> should be obvious that there are only 3 ways to leave an item off by itself

5 ways to partition


**aside:** partitions of s = {a,b,c,d}

start off by 4 subsets of singles

-- {a}, {b}, {c}, {d}

-- {a,b}, {c} {d}

> use multiple principle to count the ways to rearrange the singles

> 1st one has 4 ways to pick, 2nd one has 3 ways to pick, but we over-counted, so divide two, --> 6 ways

-- {a,b,c}, {d} --> 4 \

                            7

-- {a,b}, {c,d} --> 3  /

-- {a,b,c,d} --> 1

so total of 15 partitions


**Definition:** We say there is a `one-to-one correspondence` between sets A and B if it's possible to pair off elements of A with elements of B so that every element of A is paired with a unique element of B and vice-versa

**Example:** There is a 1-1 correspondence between A = {a,b} and B = {x,y}

**Example:** There is a 1-1 correspondence between `A = {0, {a}, b}` and `B = { {a,b}, {b}, c}`

There is no 1-1 correspondence between `A = {1,2,3}` and `B = {a,b}`

> need to have same length/size

**Definition:** Two sets have the same size

  (or `Cardinality`) if there exists a

  1-1 correspondence between the sets.

**Definiion:** Two sets are said to be finite

  if each elements can be listed and

  the list comes to an end.


**Definition:** A set is `countably infinite`

if it can be put into 1-1 correspondence

with the set `|N` of natural numbers.

A set S is called `countable` if 

it is finite or countably infinite.

**Example:** Show that the set 

E = {2,4,6,8,10,...}

is countably infinite.

E = {2 * 1, 2 * 2, 2 * 3, ...}

so 2n <-> n is 1-1 correspondence of E with |N={1,2,3,...} (natural numbers)

**Example:** Is Z = {...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...} //Z for set of integers

countably infinite?

0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,...

> you can list it, certainly coutable, countably infinite

```
        S = {a_1, a_2, a_3, ... }
```

```
S - {a_1} = {a_2, a_3, a_4, ... }
```

**Example:** Is the set of rational numbers, Q (rational numbers), countably infinite?

> **note:** the rational numbers are "dense", i.e. infinitely in between each one

> Q is counably infinite

We can list its elements

```
1  1  1
-  -  - ...
1  2  3
```

```
2  2  2
-  -  - ...
1  2  3
```

```
3  3  3
-  -  - ...
1  2  3
```

If m/n is on he "list",

the next number on the list is:

```
 m
---   if m > n
n+1


m - 1
-----  if 1 < m <= n
  n


n+1
----  if m = 1
 1

```

> now throw away the "duplicates", the result is still a list

**Example:** The set of real numbers, `|R` (real numbers), is uncountably infinite.

We'll prove that the set of real numbers (0,1) is uncoutnably infinite:

**Proof by Contradiction:**

> classic, for proof by contradiction

> a direct proof is clearly a dead-end, can try a contrapositive, but end up with contradiction

Assume that (0,1) is countably infinite

then its elements can be listed

> let's list the elements

the elements must be,

r_1  = .a_11 .a_12 .a_13 ... and so forth

r_1  = .a_21 .a_22 .a_23 ... and so forth

r_1  = .a_31 .a_32 .a_33 ... and so forth

...

Construct the number

q = . b_1 b_2 b_3 ...

where b_1 = { a_nn -1   if a_nn!=0 }

            { 5 if a_nn = 0 }


note that q !e (0,1)

but q is not on the list

since its decimal representation 

differs from that of each r_n

in at least the nth decimal place

> this is `Cantor's Theorem`


## Homework Problems #8
something to think about, see if we can prove a few things

1. Prove that the union of two countably inifinite sets is countably infinite

2. Prove that the union of a countably infinite collection of countably infinite sets is countably infinite

3. Prove that the number of possible computer programs is countably infinite

4. Prove that the number of functions from N to {0,...,9} is uncountably infinite

> #4 points that functions are non-computable?

5. Use the fact that (0,1) is countably infinite to show that R is uncountable
