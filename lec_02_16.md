# Chapter 1 Topics

## arithmetic sequence

a, a + d, a + 2d, a+3d, a+4d, ..., a+(n-1)d


sum of 1st n terms = n * (avg of 1st & last terms)

In particular, SUM of i from i=1 to n = n(n+1)/2

s = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n

s = n+(n-1) + ... + 1

2s = n(n+1)


## Geometric Sequence

a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, ...

sum of the first n terms will be a(1-r^n)/(1-r) === a(r^n-1)/(r-1)

rS = ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^n

s  = a + ar + ... + ar^(n-1)

---------------------------------

(r-1)s = ar^n - a

       = a(r^n-1)

## Mathematical Proofs

### Example, use a direct proof to prove that 

If a and b are real numbers, then sqrt( (a^2+b^2)/2 ) >= (a+b)/2

Direct Proof:

Assume a,b are real numbers

then (a-b)^2 >= 0

* expand exponent
* add 2ab both sides
* divide 4
* sqrt both sides


### Example, of contrapositive proof

IF a != b, then (a+b)/2 > sqrt(ab)

**Contrapositive Proof:**

Assume (a+b)/2 <= sqrt(ab)

... some algebra ...

a = b


### Exmaple, of another contrapositive proof

IF 2^N-1 is prime, THEN N is prime.

**Contrapositive Proof:**

Assume N is composite,

THEN N = ab where a,b are integers > 1

Now if S = ...

2^N - 1 = 2^(ab) - 1

= (2^b - 1)(2^((a-1) * b) + 2^((a-2)b) + 2^((a-3)b) + ... + 2^b + 1)

> This is the direction we want to go, how do we put this together?

> What is that ... thing?

a(r^n-1)/(r-1) * (2^b)^a

Now if S = 1 + 2^b + 2^(2b) + ... + 2^(a-1)b

THEN s = ((2^b)^a-1)/(2^b-1) = (2^(ab)-1)/(2^b-1)

So 2^(ab)-1 = (2^b-1)(s) => 2^N is composite


### Example of, Proof by Contradiction

3.b.  Not possible to "tile" an 8x8 checkerboard with opposite corners removed, using dominoes.

Proof by Contradiction:

Assume it **is** possible to make 

Note that he colors on the board alternate, so each domino covers exactly two colors.

So each domino covers exactly two tiles

So, the number of black squares = the number of red squares = the number of dominoes used

But this means that opp corners of checkerboard are of opposite colors (Contradiction)

#### general flow of a contradiction proof

IF p then q

~pvq

~(~pvq) = p^~q

=>

=>

=> contradiction

### Power Sets

If A is any set, the power set of A, is denoted P(A), is the set of all subets of A

|P(A)| = 2^|A|


### Homework Question, p53, #24

R1 equiv relation on S1

R2 equiv relation on S2

R defiend on S1 x S2 by:

(x1,x2) R (y1,y2) iff

x1R1y1 and x2R2y2

**R is an equiv relation on S1xS2**

Proof: (1) Assume (x1,x2) e S1xS2

then x1R1x1 and x2R2x2

because R1 and R2 are reflexive!

therefore (x1,x2) R (x1,x2)

thus R is reflexive

(2) Assume (x1,x2) R (y1,y2)

THEN x1R1y1 and x2R2y2

So, y1R1x1 and y2R2x2

because R1,R2 are symetric

therefore (y1,y2) R (x1,x2)

thus S is smmetric


(3) Assume (x1,x2) R (y1,y2)

and (y1,y2) R (z1,z2)

then z1R1y1, and y1R1Z1 => x1R1Z1

also, x2R2y2 and y2R2Z2 => x2R2Z2

thus (x1,x) R (z1,z2)

hence R is transitive!

Since R is refleive, symm, and trans, R is an equiv relation!

(x1,x2) e C[(y1,y2)]

Suppose (x1,x2) R (y1,y2)

hen x1R1y1 and x2R2y2

so x1ec1[y1] and x2eC2[y2]

therefore (x1,x2) e C1[y1]xC2[y2]

therefore C[y1,y2] c= C1[y1]xC2[y2]

Suppose (x1,x2)eC1(y1)xC2(y2)

then x1eC1(y1), x2eC2(y2)

therefore, x11ry1 and x2r2y2

therefore (x1,x2)R(y1,y2)

=> (x1,x2) e C[(y1,y2)]

thus C1(y1)xC2(y2) c= C[(y1,y2)]

### Homework Problem, #18

S = set of ordered pairs of all positive integers

(x1,x2)R(y1,y2) iff x1+y2=y1+x2

For any pair, (x1,x2), x1+x2=x1+x2  reflexive

Suppose (x1,x2)R(y1,y2)

then x1+y2 = y1+x2 => y1+x2 = x1+y2, therefore (y1,y2) R (x1,x2), Symmetry!

Suppose (x1,x2)R(y1,y2) and (y1,y2) R(z1,z2)

then x1+y2 = y+x2

and y1+z1=z1+y2

so, x1+z2 = .... = z1+x2

xz-x2 = y1-y2

y1-y2 = z1 - z2

so x1-y2 = z1-z2

=> x1+z2 = z1+x2

### Homework Prob. Review, #26

"circular": xRy and yRz => zRx

> looks like transitivity turned around

Prove that R is an equiv relation iff R is reflexive and circular

Proof:

> go with the (=>) forward direction

> i need symmetry, & reflexive

Assume that R is an equiv relation

then xRy and yRz (R is trans)

=> xRz (R is symm)

thereforce R is circular

R is reflex b/c it's an equiv rel.

> finally, we need to do the other implication, going the other way

(<=) Assume R is reflexive and circular

> we already have refelx

> how to show symm?

suppose xRy, then yRy (R is reflexive!)

implies that (by circularity) yRx

thus R is symm

suppose xRy and yRz then zRx (R circular) => xRz (R symm)

> and circularity easily implies transitivity

therefore, it is an equiv relation
