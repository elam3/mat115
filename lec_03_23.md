## Example

**Prove:** Every sequence of n<sup>2</sup>+1 distinct real numbers

contains a subsequence of length n+1 that is either strictly

increasing or strictly decreasing.

 a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 , ...

 a1 , a3 , a4 , a7 , ...

 > "subsequence"


### sub-example of sequence/subsequence

10 items

n = 3

n<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 10

**Proof by Contradiction:**

Suppose a1 , a2 , ... , a<sub>n<sup>2</sup>+1</sub>

is a sequence of n<sup>2</sup>+1 distinct real numbers and there is no

subsequence of length n+1 or more that is strictly incr or decr.

Let I<sub>i</sub> = length of the longest 

strictly increasing subsequence starting at a<sub>i</sub>.

Let D<sub>i</sub> = length of the longest strictly decreasing 

subsequence starting at a<sub>i</sub>

Consider the ordered pairs (I<sub>i</sub>, D<sub>i</sub>)

By our assumption there are at most n<sup>2</sup> distinct pairs.

Thus, there exists i and j,

with ( I<sub>i</sub>, D<sub>i</sub>) = (I<sub>j</sub>, D<sub>j</sub>)

Suppose a<sub>i</sub> precedes a<sub>j</sub> in the sequence

If a<sub>i</sub> < a<sub>j</sub>, then a<sub>i</sub> along with the incr

subsequence starting at a<sub>j</sub> is an incr subseq. of len 1 more than

Ij = Ii (contradiction)

If ai > aj, then ai along with the dec. subseq. starting at aj has len

1 more than Dj = Di (contradiction)

## Example:

In a large lecture section, 50 of the students own a car, 32 own a bicycle,

and 20 own both.

How many own either a car or a bicycle?

| A &cup; B | = |A| + |B| - |A&cap;B|

50 + 32 = 82

\- 20

---------------

= 62

## Example

50 own a car

32 own a bike

40 own a computer

20 own a car and bike

18 own a bike and a computer

30 own a car and a compuer

How many own all 3?

|A&cup;B&cup;C| = |A| + |B| + |C|

\- |A&cap;B| - |A&cap;C| - |B&cap;C|

\+ |A&cap;B&cap;C|

50 + 32 + 40 - 20 -18 - 30 + 10 = 122 - 68 + 10 = `64`

## Generalization

|A<sub>1</sub>&cap;A<sub>2</sub>&cap;A<sub>3</sub>&cap; ... &cap; A<sub>n</sub>|

= |A<sub>1</sub>| + |A<sub>2</sub>| + |A<sub>3</sub>| + ... + |A<sub>n</sub>|

\- | A<sub>1</sub> &cap; A<sub>2</sub> | - | A<sub>1</sub> &cap; A<sub>3</sub> | - ... - | A<sub>n-1</sub> &cap; A<sub>n</sub> |

\+ | A<sub>1</sub> &cap; A<sub>2</sub> &cap; A<sub>3</sub> | + ... + |A<sub>n-2</sub> &cap; <sub>n-1</sub> &cap; <sub>n</sub> |

\- ... + (-1)<sup>n-1</sup> | A<sub>1</sub> &cap; A<sub>2</sub> &cap; A<sub>3</sub> &cap; ... &cap; A<sub>n</sub> |

> Can do this by proof induction. Do it as exercise.

**Combinatorial Proof:**

Claim: each element of A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub> &cup; ... &cup; A<sub>n</sub>


is counted exactly once by the formula given.

Let x be an arbitrary element of A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub> &cup; ... &cup; A<sub>n</sub>

Suppose x is an element of m of the sets A<sub>1</sub>, ... A<sub>n</sub>.


So, in the formula, x is count the following no. of times:

m - C(m,2) + C(m,3) - C(m,4) + ... (-1)<sup>m-1</sup>C(m,m)

= C(m,1) - C(m,2) + C(m,3) - C(m,4) + ... + (-1)<sup>m-1</sup>C(m,m)

= C(m,0) - [ C(m,1) - C(m,2) + C(m,3) - C(m,4) + ... + (-1)<sup>m</sup>C(m,m) ]

= C(m,0) - k=0,m &sum; C(m,k) (1)<sup>k</sup> (-1)<sup>m-k</sup>

= C(m,0) - (1+(-1))<sup>m</sup>

= C(m,0) - 0

= C(m,0) = 1

Since x was arbitrary, this completes the proof.

## Example

A raffle sells 100 tickets, one to a customer. The 4-member Smith family

buys 4 tickets. There are 4 winning tickets.

How many of the outcomes make the Smith family Happy?

Let A<sub>i</sub> = event that i<sup>th</sup> Smith wins.

We want:

| A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub> &cup; A<sub>3</sub> &cup; A<sub>4</sub> |

= |A<sub>1</sub>| + |A<sub>2</sub>| +|A<sub>3</sub>| + |A<sub>4</sub>| - |A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub>| ...

= 4 C(99,3) - C(4,2) C(98,2) + C(4,3) C(97,1) - C(4,4) C(96,0)

= `599,265`

## Example

How many "derangements" are there of n objects?

> Derangement: permutation of arrangement where none of the objects are in their original positions

Let A<sub>i</sub> = set of permutations that leave i<sup>th</sup> element fixed

then, the no. of erangements is the

`total number of permutations` - |A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub> &cup; ... &cup; A<sub>n</sub>|

= n! - [ n(n-1)! - C(n,2)(n-1)! + C(n,3)(n-3)! - ... + (-1)<sup>n-1</sup>C(n,n)]

= n! - [n! - n!/2! + n!/3! - ... + (-1)<sup>n-1</sup> n!/n!]

= n! [ 1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + 1/4! - ... + (-1)<sup>n</sup>

Note that the ratio of `no. of derangements`/`no. of permutations`

is: 1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)<sup>n</sup>/n!

> from 110B, you know that as n->&infin; this no. -> e<sup>-1</sup> = 1/e ~= 0.36...


Suppose

A = {a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> }

B = {b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, ..., b<sub>n</sub> }

Assume n>=m

Consider the functions f:A\-\>B

How many of these functions are `onto`?

> there should be m<sup>n</sup> functions

How many of those functions are `onto`?

Let F<sub>i</sub> = set of functions from A to B that leave b<sub>i</sub> unassigned.

the no. of `onto` functions 

= m<sup>n</sup> - |F<sub>1</sub> &cup; F<sub>2</sub> &cup; ... &cup; F<sub>m</sub> |

= m<sup>n</sup> - [ m(m-1)<sup>n</sup> - C(m,2)(m-2)<sup>n</sup> + C(m,3)(m-3)<sup>n</sup> - ... + C(m,m)(m-m)<sup>n</sup> ]

= <sub>k=0,m</sub &sum; (-1)<sup>k</sup> C(m,k) (m-k)<sup>n</sup>

= `onto` {n,m}

### Another way of counting `onto` functions

We can alos count the no. of onto functions as follows:

| A | B |
|---|---|
|a<sub>1</sub>|b<sub>1</sub>|
|a<sub>2</sub>|b<sub>2</sub>|
|a<sub>3</sub>|b<sub>3</sub>|
| ... | ... |
|a<sub>49</sub>|b<sub>m</sub>|
| ... | ... |
|a<sub>n</sub>||

S<sub>1</sub>: Create a partition of A into m non-empty subsets N<sub>1</sub> = ?

S<sub>2</sub>: Arrange the 


So, onto {n,m} = N<sub>1</sub> &dot; m ! (by mult. principle)

&there4; N<sub>1</sub> = (`onto`{n,m})/m!

= k=0,m &sum; (-1)<sup>k</sup> m!/(k!(n-k)!) (m-k)<sup>n</sup>

"partition n,m" --> {n,m} = k=0,m &sum; (-1)<sup>k</sup>

...

No. of ways to partition set with n elts into m non-empty subets = {n,m} = k=0,m &sum; ...
