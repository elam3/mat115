## Homework Review
### p.406 #30
Prove: 2 C(n,2) + n<sup>2</sup> = C(2n,2) for n>=2

2 C(n,2) + C(n,1) * C(n,1) = C(2n,2)

2 C(n,2) + C(n,1) * C(n,1) = C(2n,2)

Suppose we have a group of n men and n women.

The number of ways to choose two people from the group is C(2n, 2).

But the `number of 2 member selections` = `number of selections of 1 men and 1 women` + `number of selections with 2 men or 2 women`

= C(n,1) * C(n,1) + C(2,1) * C(n,2)

## Combinatorial Proofs
### Example
Use a combinatorial argument to prove that <sub>k=1</sub><sup>n</sup>&sum; k<sup>2</sup> C(n,k) = n(n+1)2<sup>n-2</sup>

C(n,k) * C(k,1) * C(k,1) 

k * C(n,k) = n * C(n-1,k-1)

S<sub>1</sub>: Pick committee of k people
    N<sub>1</sub> = C(n,k)

S<sub>2</sub>: Pick officer of the committee
    N<sub>2</sub> = C(k,1)

Alternatively,

S<sub>1</sub>: Pick officcer
    N<sub>1</sub> = n

S<sub>2</sub>: Pick officcer
    N<sub>2</sub> = C(n-1,k-1)

<hr/>

**Combinatorial Proof:**


Note that <sub>k=1</sub><sup>n</sup>&sum; k<sup>2</sup> C(n,k)

is the total number of ways to first

select a committee of any size out of n people

and then designate 2 of those chosen

to be officers (these may be the same person)

<hr/>

This can be counted, alternatively, as follows:

`# of such selections` =  `# of selections with 2 different officers` + `# of selections with same person in both offices.`

= n(n-1)2<sup>n-2</sup> + n * 2<sup>n-1</sup> = n * 2<sup>n-2</sup>[(n-1)+2]

= n(n+1)2<sup>n-2</sup>

#### 1st term : n(n-1)2<sup>n-2</sup> : represents ... 

S<sub>1</sub>: Pick chair : N<sub>1</sub> = n

S<sub>2</sub>: Pick sec. : N<sub>2</sub> = n-1

S<sub>3</sub>: Pick other com. members : N<sub>3</sub> = 2<sup>n-2</sup>

#### 2nd term : n * 2<sup>n-1</sup> : represents...

S<sub>1</sub>: Pick officer : N<sub>1</sub> = n

S<sub>2</sub>: Pick other com. members : N<sub>2</sub> = 2<sup>n-1</sup>

### 5 Combinatorial Argument Problems:

**Prove:**

1. K C(N,K) = N(N-1,K-1)

2. <sub>k=1</sup><sup>n</sup>&sum; k C(n,k) = n 2<sup>n-1</sup>

3. <sub>k=0</sup><sup>n</sup>&sum; C(n,k)<sup>2</sup> = C(2n,n)

4. <sub>k=0</sup><sup>n</sup>&sum; C(R,k) C(W,n-k) = C(R+W,n), n < R,W

5. C(k,m) C(t,k) = C(t,m) C(t-m,t-k), m <= k <= t

### p.406 #32
**Prove:** The "hockey stick formula":

C(r,r) + C(r+1,r) + C(r+2,r) + ... + C(n,r) = C(n+1,r+1)

for 0 <= r <= n, where n is any positive integer

**Proof by INduction:**

1. **Basis Step**: For n=1,

if r=0, C(0,0) + C(1,0) = 1 + 1 = C(1+1,0+1) = C(2,1)

if r=1, C(1,1) = C(1+1,1+1) = C(2,2)

2. **Induction Hypothesis:**

suppose that there is a positive itneger k so that

C(r,r) + C(r+1,r) + ... + C(k,r) = C(k+1,r+1) for every r, 0<=r<=k.

then for any 0<=r<=k,

`C(r,r,) + C(r+1,r) + ... + C(k,r)` + C(k+1,r)

= C(k+1,r+1) + C(k+1,r)

= C(k+2,r+1) = C( (k+1) + 1, r+1)

Also if r = k+1,

C(r,r) = C(k+1,r) = C(k+2, r+1) = C( (k+1)+1, (r+1)+1)

### Example

How many distinct arrangements are there of the eleters in he word "banana"?

S<sub>1</sub>: Choose position of the a's = N<sub>1</sub> = C(6,3)

S<sub>2</sub>: Choose position of the n's = N<sub>2</sub> = C(6,2)

S<sub>3</sub>: Choose position of the b's = N<sub>1</sub> = C(1,1)

So, the number of such distinct arrangements is,

C(6,3) * C(6,2) * C(1,1) 

= 20 * 3 * 1

= 60

<hr/>

> Observe the following,

C(6,3) * C(3,2) * C(1,1)

= 6!/(3!~~3!~~) * ~~3!~~/(2!~~1!~~) + ~~1!~~/(1!~~0!~~)

= 6!/(3!2!1!)

### Example

How many arrangements are there of the letters in the word "mississippi"?

C(11,4) C(7,4) C(3,2) C(1,1)

11!/(4!7!) * 7!/(4!3!) * 3!/(2!1!) * 1!(1!0!)

= 11!/(4!4!2!1!)

<hr/>

Suppose S is a set of n objects 

of k "types", with n<sub>i</sub> objects of type i

the # of distinguishable permutations

of the element of S is :

n!/(n<sub>1</sub>! * n<sub>2</sub>! * n<sub>3</sub>! * ... * n<sub>k</sub>!) = "Multinomial Coefficient"

= C(n, n1\*n2\*...\*nk)

### Example:

Suppose 21 people show up at a chess club to play. There will be

10 matches and one bye.

In how many was can the matches and bye be arranged.

P1P2P3 ...P21

21!/[(2!)<sup>10</sup> * 1!] / 10! = `49,893,498,214,560,000`/`3,628,800`

### Example: 
Suppose 15 people are going to divide up

to play a baseketball game with 5 left-over

to watch..

In how many ways can the two teams and the spectators be chosen?

P1P2...P15

Should be 15!/(5!5!5!) * 1/2! = 378,378
