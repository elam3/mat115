## Homework Review
### p.75
X = set of real numbers

for x&isin;X, g(x) = ln(x)

yes, g is not function on domain X.

### #65
Prove: If f:x -> y, and g: y-> z, are both 1-1 functions

then gf: x -> z, is also 1-1

**Direct Proof:** 

Assume f: x -> y, and g:y -> z  is 1-1

Suppose gf(a)=gf(b) where a,b&isin;X

g is 1-1, so f(a)=f(b)

But f is 1-1, so f(a)=f(b) implies that a=b

since a and b are arbitrary,

this shows that gf is 1-1.

## Do some stuff with functions

### Example
Let A = {1,2,3}, B = {a,b}

How many are functions f:A -> B are onto?

> 6

How many are 1-1?

0

How many are neither?

> 2

> we have a (\*,b), "something, b"

> we have a (\*,a), "something, b"

## more examples on, Mathematical Induction

### Example
Prove that for any positive integer n, n < 2^n.

**Proof:** 

(1) Basis Step:

For n=1, 1<2^1 = 2
> This works!

(2) Induction Hypothesis:

Assume that for some positive integer k, k<2^k.

Then k+1 <= k+k < 2^k+2^k = 2\*2^k = 2^(k+1)


### Example
Prove that, for all integers n greater than or equal to 4, 2^n\<n!

**Proof:** 
(1) Basis Step: For n=4, 2^4\<4! = 24

(2) Induction Hypotheisis:

Assume that 2^k < k! for some integer k>=4.

2^(k+1) = 2\*2^k < 2\*k! < (k+1)k! = (k+1)!


### Example
Prove that `2^(2n) - 1` is divisble by 3, for all positive integers n.

**Proof:**

(1) Basis Step: 2^(2\*1)-1 = 4-1 = 3 
> This works!

(2) Induction Hypotheiss:

assume there is positive integer so that 2^(2k)-1 is a multiple of 3

then 2(2k)-1 = 3L for some integer L.

> reminder of what divisibility means

So, 2^(2(k+1)) - 1 = 2^((2k)+2)-1

= 2^(2k) * 2^2 - 1 = 4 * 2^(2k) - 1 = (3+1)\*2^(2k) - 1

= (3 * 2^(2k) + 2^(2k)) - 1

= 3 * 2^(2k) + 3 * L

= 3[ 2^(2k) + L] => **2^(2(k+1)) - 1 is divisible by 3**


### Example
Show that for any integer n>=10,

n^3 < 2^n.

**Proof:**:

(1) Basis Step:

> We try small integers and see it doesn't really work out,

> until we get to 10,

> so we Start off at n = 10,

For n = 10, 10^3 = 1000 < 2^10 = 1024

(2) Induction Hypothesis:

Assume that k^3 < 2^k for some positive integer k >= 10.

Then (k+1)^3 = [k(1+ 1/k)]^3

= k^3( 1 + 1/k )^3

< 2^k(1+ 1/k)^3

<= 2^k(1.1)^3

<= 2^k * 2 = 2^(k+1)


### Example

The harmonic numbers Hn are defiend by:

Hn = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/n

Prove that H\_(2^n) >= 1 + n/2 for all positive integers n.

Proof by Induction:

(1) Basis Step: For n=1, H\_2^1 = 1 + 1/2 >= 1 + 1/2 
> That worked!

(2) Induction Hypothesis: 

Assume that H\_(2^k) >= 1 + k/2 for some positive integer k.

Then H\_(2^k+1) = `1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/2^k` + 1/(2^k + 1) + 1/(2^k + 2) + ... + 1/2^(k+1) 

\>= `1 + k/2` + 1/(2^k+1) + 1/(2^k+2) + ... + 1/(2^(k+2))

\> 1 + k/2 + 2^k * 1/(2^k+1)

= 1 + k/2 + 1/2 = 1 + (k+1)/2

> Checks out!


### Example

Suppose a post office sells only 2cent & 5cent stamps.

Prove that any postage of 4cents or more can be paid using only these stamps.

**Proof by Induction:**

(1) Basis Step:  For n = 4, we can use 2cent stamps to make postage of 4cents.

(2) Induction Hypothesis: Suppose that kcents postage can be paid in 2cents 

and 5cent stamps where k>=4.

If the kcent postage uses at least one 5cent stamp, replace it with 3 2cent 

stamps to get k+1cent postage using only 2cent and 5cent stamps.

If the kcent psotage uses no 5cent stamps, then it uses at least 2 2cent 

stamps because k>=4. Replace 2 2cent stamps with a 5cent stamp to get k+1cent 

postage.


### Example
Show that any 2^n x 2^n chessboard with one square removed can be "tiled" 

using L-shaped tri-ominoes.

> First off, what is tiling? It's a covering, with no gap and no overlap.

> Best advice: Try it out.

> Let's try when n = 1

> Have to remove 1 square
