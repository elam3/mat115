### Hwk Review

p.586 12)  `(p->q) v (~q^p) is a tautology.` 

The following is the truth table for (p-q)v(~q^p)

|p|q|p->q|~q|~q^p|(p->q)v(~q^p)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|F|F|T|T|F|T|
|F|T|T|F|F|T|
|T|F|F|T|T|T|
|T|T|T|F|F|T|

### Example: Show that (p->q)->r and p->(q->r) are **not** logically equivalent.

|p|q|r|(p->q)|(p->q)->r|p->(q->r)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|F|F|F|T|F|T|T|
|F|F|T|T|T|T|T|
|F|T|F|T|F|F|T|
|F|T|T|T|T|T|T|
|T|F|F|F|T|T|T|
|T|F|T|F|T|T|T|
|T|T|F|T|F|F|F|
|T|T|T|T|T|T|T|

Are not logically equivalent, because they have different columns in the truth table.


### Review from last time: Logical Equivalences
* Double Negation : `~~p <-> p`
* Commutatitivity : `pvq <-> qvp`
* Associativity : 
* Distributitivy : `pv(q^r) <-> (pvq)^(pvr)`
* DeMorgan's Law : `~(pvq)<->~p^~q`
* DeMorgan's Law : `(p^q) <-> ~pv~q`

  > We'll talk about DeMorgan's again when we get to sets

* Implication : `(p->q) <-> ~pvq`

### Identity Laws
* `p ^ T <-> p`
* `p v F <-> p`

### Domination Laws
* `p ^ F = F`
* `p v T = T`

### Idempotency

> Doing something to itself

* `p ^ p <-> p`
* `p v p <-> p`

## How to use these in proofs

### Example: Prove that `~(pv(~p^q))<-> ~p^~q`

> One way to prove it would be to draw a truth table.
> But we can also use our basic laws to do this instead.

#### Proof:
|||
|---|---|
|~(pv(~p^q)) | Given |
|~p^~(~p^q)| DeMorgan I |
|~p^(~~pV~q)| DeMorgan II |
|~p^(pv~q)| Double Negation |
|(~p^p)v(~p^~q)| Distributive Law|
|Fv(~p^~q)| Law of Excluded Middle|
|~p^~q|Identity Law|


### Example: Prove [(pvq)^~p] is a tautology.

|||
|---|---|
| (1) (pvq) | Given |
| (2) ~p | Given |
| (3) => ~~pvq | Double Negation |
| (4) <=> ~p->q | Implication |
| (5) q | (2) and (4)|

> This was probably easier done by truth table. But this is just demonstration that we can still use our laws, and get practice with proofs.

## An important kind of tautology is called a `rule of inference`.
A `rule of inference` has the form `A=>B`, "A implies B".

### Important Inference Rules
1. Modus Punens 

    `[(p->q)^p] => q`

    > We can verify Modus Punens by using a truth table

    |p|q|p->q)|[(p->q)^p]=>q|
    |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
    |F|F|T|F|T|
    |F|T|T|F|T|
    |T|F|F|F|T|
    |T|T|T|T|T|


2. `Modus Tollens`

    `[(p->q)^~q]=>~p`

3. `Separation`

    `(p^q)=>p`

4. `Joining`

    `p=>(pvq)`

5. `Law of Syllogism`

    `[(p->q)^(q->r)]=>(p->r)`


## Methods of Mathematical Proof

> Here we're just using laws of syllogism, that's what's going on.

1. `Direct Proof`
    
    **Example**: Prove that `if n is an odd integer,`
    `then n^2 is odd`

    > Assume the IF part, and arrive at the THEN part

    **Direct Proof:**

    Assume n is an odd integer.

    > Assume the if part, and think, where did that get me?

    then n=2k+1, for some integer k

    > From Law of Syllogism, we got `[(p->q)^(q->r)]=>(p->r)`

    > We did the p->q part, now we need the q->r part

    so, n^2 =(2k+1)^2 = (2k^2) + 2(2k) + 1^2

    = 2[2k&2+2k) + 1 = 1 more than a ...

    So, n^2 is odd

### Another example: Prove that If n an odd integer, then n is the difference of two s quares.

> need to gain some insight...

> Going to short-circuit this by doing a direct proof

> We're doing direct proof, so we know how to start, we assume the IF part

**Direct Proof:**

Assume n is an odd integer

> Where does that take me? How does it help?

then n = 2k+1 for some integer k

> it's 1 more than a multiple of 2

so, n = k^2 + 2k + 1 - k^2

= (k+1)^2 - k^2

**therefore** n is the difference of two squares!


### Let's try something not so simple,

**Example:** Prove that If 2^N - 1 is a prime number,
then 2^(N-1) * (2^N-1) is a perfect number.

> A perfect number is an integer that equal the sum of their proper divisors

> e.g. 6 = 1+2+3 is the smallest perfect number

> next one?

> 28 = 1+2+4+7+14 is the next "perfect" number


> This looks like a perfect candidate for a direct proof

**Direct Proof:**

Assume: 2^N -1 is prime

> What are the prime factors of this, `2^(N-1) * (2^N-1)` , number?

then the proper divisors of 2^(N-1)(2^N-1)

are: 1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(N-1), (2^N-1), 2(2^N-1), ..., 2^(N-2)(2^N-1)

So, the sum of the proper divisors of 2^N-1(2^N-1) is:

1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^N-1 + (2^N-1) + 2(2^N-1) + ... + 2^(N-2)(2^N-1)

> Notice I can group these,

`1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^N-1` + `(2^N-1) + 2(2^N-1) + ... + 2^(N-2)(2^N-1)`

> And they are geometric progressions!

= (1-2^N)/(1-2) + (2^N-1)[1+2+...+2^N-2]

= (2^N-1) + (2^N-1)[ (1-2^(N-1)) / (1-2) ]

= (2^N-1) [ ~~1~~ + [2^(N-1) - ~~1~~]] 

= 2^(N-1)(2^N-1)


### Another example

**Example**: Prove that If n is an integer and n^2 is odd, then n is odd.

**Direct Proof:**

Assume n^2 is odd

then n^2 = 2k+1

(DEAD END)

> This didn't work, so let's try a `Proof by Contrapositive`

**Proof by Contrapositive:**

IF n is even, then n^2 is even

Assume: n is even

then n = 2k for some integer k

so n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2[2k^2]

so n^2 is even


**Example**: Prove that If x is irrational, then 1/x is irrational

Contrapositive: If 1/x is rational, then x is rational.

> How do you prove something is irrational? That's kind of hard. So instead, we prove that something is rational. via contrapositive.

**Proof by Contrapositive**:

Assume: 1/x is rational

then 1/x = a/b where a and b are integers

so x=1/(a/b) = b/a => x is rational

> That was very easy w/ contrapositive. Maybe impossible, or very difficult with direct proof


### Proof by Contradiction
**Exmple**: Prove that If n is a perfect square, then n+2 is **not** a perfect square.

**`Proof by Contradiction`** : Assume the IF part, and NOT then THEN part.

Assume: n is a perfect square, 

and n+2 is a perfect square

then n=k^2, n+2=L^2

so (n+2)-n=L^2-k^2

2 = L^2 - K^2

2 = (L+k)(L-k)

So L+k = 2

L-k = 1

2L = 3

L = 3/2

k = 1/2

=> 3/2 and 1/2 are integers (contradiction)
