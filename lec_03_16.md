## Homework Review?
### Example
How many ways are there to arrange the letters in the word "papaya"? 

6!/(3!/2!/1!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3!)/(3!2!) = 60 ways

### Example
Each member of a 14-member committee is to be assigned to exactly one

of four sub-committees:

A 5-member subcommittee

A 4-member subcommittee

A 3-member subcommittee

A 2-member subcommittee

= 14!/(5!4!3!2!) = `21,280` 

<hr/>

> Recall that these are often time referred to as "MULTINOMIAL PERMUTATIONS"

( A1 + A2 + A3 + ... + Ak )<sup>n</sup>

= (i+i2+..+ik=n)&sum; n!/(i1!i2!...ik!) A1^i1A2^i2...Ak^ik

<hr/>

### Example
How many ways are there to deal hands of 7 cards to each to 5 players

from a standard 52-card deck?

One way:

52!/[(7!)^5\*17!]

### Example
How many lines connecting n points?

C(number of points, 2) 

### Example

In how many ways can 8 oatmeal cookies be distributed to 3 children?

> The complication comes in where the cookies are not identifiable

We can draw it out, such that there are 3 boxes, and 3 children

```
        |       |
        |       |
------------------------
James     Holly    Kyle
```

Number of distributions = No. of sequences of 8 cookies and 2 `|`s

i.e. 8 cookies, and 2 divisors

= C(10,2) = `45`

<hr/>

k items --> pick n with repetitions

```

    n selection's

** | | * | ... | *** 
----------------------

    k-1 "dividers"

```

no of such selections = C(n+k-1, k-1)

The number of selections of n outo f k items,

with repetition allowd, is:

C(n+k-1,k-1) = C(n+k-1, n)

<hr/>

What if each child gets at least 1 cookie?

C(5+2, 2) = C(7,2) = 21

### Example
How many 8-bit strings with exactly 2 1's are such that the 2 1's are not adjacent?

How many sequences f 5 0's and 2 dividers?

= C(5 more zeroes + 3 boxes - 1, 3 boxes - 1)

= C(7,2)

= 21

> How do we check? Count it in another way

**Alternative Method:**

No. of such strings

 = total no. of strings - no. of strings with 1's adjacent

 = C(8,2) - C(7,1) = 28 - 7 = 21 &#10003;
 
> glue the 2 adjacent 1's together, and treat it as 1, so 7 items choose 1

### Example

How many solutions to the equation `x+y+z=5` are there if x,y,z must

all be non-negative integers?

```
    | 1111 |  1
111 |   1  |  1
-------------------
```

 = no. of ways to distribute 5 cookies to 3 children

 = C(5+3-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = `21`

<hr/>

> Time for new Counting Principle

### Example

Prove that, in any group of 27 English words

at least 2 start with the same letter.

**Proof:** Assumme each of the 27 words start with a different letter

Then there are 27 different letters in the alphabet

(Contradiction!)

If we insert N items into K boxes, and N > K,

then there is at least 1 box with 2 or more items.

> sometimes called the "Dirichlet Box Principle", aka (Pigeon Hole Principle)

### **Generalized Box Principle**

If `N` objects are placed into `K` boxes,

there is at least one box containing at least &lceil;N/K&rceil; objects

> &lceil; x &rceil; = **"ceiling function"**

> = "least integer" >= x

> &lfloor; x &rfloor; = **"floor function"**

> "greatest integer" <= x

**Proof**: Suppose there is no box with at least &lcei;N/k&rceil; objects.

then, the total number of objects

is <= K [ &lcei;N/K&rcei;-1 ] < K [ (N/K+1)-1 ]

> that less than is strictly less!

(Contradiction)


### Example

If any group of 100 people,

there are at least 9 who were born in the same month.

12 months = 12 "boxes", so k=12

100 people = 100 objects, so n=100

According to the generalized box principle, (GBP),

there is at least one box (month) with at least 

&lcei; 100/12 &rcei; persons

= &lcei; 8 1/3 &rcei; = 9


### Example

What is the minimum number of students in a class to ensue that at least 6

will receive the same grade?

we want the least N, so that &lceil; n/5 &rceil; = 6

we want the least n, so that  5 < n/5 <= 6

> has to be strictly less

25 < n <= 30

`N = 26`

### Last Example

> typical use of the PHP (Pidgeon Hole Princicple)

**Prove:** Among any 6 person there are either 3 who are mutual friends,

or 3 who are complete strangers

**Proof:** Assume we have a group of 6 persons.

> pick one person, call o person out

Call one person A.

Each of the other people, other persons,

either know A, or they are strangers to A

> two boxes, "Know A", "Don't know A"

By the box principle, one of these categories contain at least 

&lceil; 5/2 &rceil; = 3 persons

**case 1:** there are at least 3 who know A.

if any 2 of these know each other, 

they along with A form a group of 3 who know each other

if no 2 these know each other, then they form a group of 3 or more who don't know each other.


**case 2:**

there are at least 3 who don't know A

if any 2 of these don't know each other, then

they along with A form a group of 3 who are strangers

if no 2 of these don't know each other,
    
they form a group of 3 (or more) who know each other
