> just use a diagonal argument

f1,f2,f3,...

Consider the function fn where fn is defiend by:

fn(k) = { fk(k)-1 if fk(k)!+0}
        { 9 if fk(k) = 0 }

Can also do it this way,

do decimal expansion

and exhibit a 1-1 correspondence

> easiest way is to mimic he diagonal argument

## Certesian Set

> Remember the last time we talked about sets, we mentioned the idea of a Cartesian set.

Recall: If A and B are any sets, then A x B = set of ordered pairs (x,y)

where xeA, yeB.

### Example 1

> look at one of the problems from p.47

Prove: (A x C) n (B x D) = (AnB)x(CnD)

> trying to prove these two sets are equal, 

> standard wy to do so, is to use inclusion argument

> start by picking something on the left

> but since dealing w/ cross product, knowing one elementi s an ordered pair might be helpful?

**Proof by Inclusion argument:** Suppoe (x,y) e (aXC)n(BxD)

> take note the fact we are dealing with cross product, and one element is an orered pair

then (x,y) e (AC) and (x,y) e (BxD)

> `and`, it's in both

then (x,y) e (aXC)

> by def of cross product

> x is in a, x is in b, so x is in ...

=> xeA and yeC and xeB and yeD

=> xe(AnB) and ye(CnD)

=> (x,y) e (AnB)x(CnD)

since (x,y) was arbitrary,

this shows that

(AxC)n(BxD)c=(AnB)x(CnD)

> in inclusion style proof, it's good idea to see if you can reverse the steps

> get across the fact that we're dealing with a cross product, we're dealing with an ordred pair


### Example 2

Example: Suppose Sue likes the colors red and blue,

Tom likes only green, and Wayne likes 

blue, green and yellow.

It's natural to construct a set of ordered pairs

The first entry a person, 

a color:

Set R = { (Sue,red), (Sue,blue), (Tom,green), (Wayne,blue), (Wayne,green),
(Wayne,yellow) }

A = {S,T,W}

B = {r,b,g,y}

AxB = { `(S,r), (S,b)`, (S,g), (S,y),

(T,r), (T,b), `(T,g)`, (T,y),

(W,r), `(W,b), (W,g), (W,y)`

}

**Definition:** We say that R is a `relation` from set A to set B if R

is a subset of AxB.

If (x,y) is an element of R, 

we of ten write xRy, or x~y.

### Example 3

Suppose A has n elements and B has m elements.

How many relations are there from A to B?

> How many items in the cross product? n * m

> How many subsets of that? 2^(m * n)

There are 2^(m * n) such relations

### Definition
**Definition:** A `relation on a set` A is any subset of AxA.

### Example 4

Suppose set A has n elements.

How many relations on A are possible?

There are 2^n^2 such relations.

### Example 5

Let A = {1,2,3,4}

Let R = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4) }

Note that R is a relation on A.

Note that xRy if x < y.

Simarlarly,

R2 = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(2,4),(3,3),(4,4)}

is a relation on A

we say xR2y if x|y

### Special properties of `Relations`

Some relations have one or more special properties.

Suppose R is a relation on set A.

Then,

1. for each xeA, xRx, we say R is `reflexive`.

2. if yRx, whenever xRy, we say R is `symmetric`.

3. if xRz whenever xRy and yRz, we say R is `transiive`.

### Example 6

Let A = {a,b,c,d}

State whether each of the following relations is reflexive, symmetric,

or transitive.

1. R = {(a,a), (a,b), (a,d), (b,a), (b,b), (b,c), (c,b), (d,a), (d,d)}

> aRa, bRb, dRd, but !cRc. So not reflexive

> is symmetric

> transitive? 1 counter-example

2. R = {a,b), (b,c), (a,c)}

> Is it reflexive? No.

> Is it symmetric? No.

> Is it transitive? Yes.

3. R = {(a,a), (a,b), (b,a), (b,b),

(c,b), (c,c), (d,d) }

> Reflexive? We got (a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (d,d). Got all of them. Yes.

> Symmetric? (a,b)&(b,a), (c,b) but no (b,c) No.

> Transitive? No.

4. R = {(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (d,d)}

> Reflexive? Yes.

> Symmetric? Yes.

> Transitive? Yes.

### Definition
**Definition:** A relation R on set A is called an `equivalence relation`

if R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

### Example 7
Let A = set of ccsf students

Let xRy if x and y have last

names that start with the same letter

then R is an equivalence relation

> Trivially checks out

### Example 8
Let A = set of integers greater than 1

Let xRy if x and y have the same number of distinct prime divisors

R is an equivalence relation.

> in an obvious sort of way, we see this is an equivalence relation

### Definition
Model of Equal Relation

**Definition:** Suppose R is an `equivalence relation` on

set A and X is any element of A.

the `equivalence class` of x, denoted by c(x),

is the set of elements yeA such that yRx.

### Example 9

Let A = set of all integer

Let xRy mean that x-y is a multiple of 3

then R is an equivalence relation.

The equivalence classes are:

> step back, slow down, and check the equivalence relation

x - y = k * 3

y - x = -k * 3

x - z = (x-y)+(y-z)

= k * 3 + m * 3

= (k+m) * 3


> class of zero

```
c[0] = {...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...}
c[1] = {...,-5,-2,1,4,7,10,...}
c[2] = {...,-4,-1,2,5,8,...}
c[3] = c[0]
c[4] = c[1]
etc.
```

> the important idea here,

**Theorem:** The equivalence classes for an equivalence relation R on set A always form a partition of A.

Proof: It suffices to show that if x!Ry, then c[x]nc[y] = 0.

So, suppose zec[x]nc[y]

let a be any element of c[x]

aec[x] => aRx

z e c[x] n c[y] => z e c[x] => zRx

so aRx => xRa

and zRx => zRa

But z e c[y] also => zRy

So zRa => aRz and zRy

So aRy => a e C[y]

Since a was arbitrary, this imples c[x] c= c[y]

simiarly, we cn prove c[y] c= c[x]

therefore, c[x] = c[y]


### Example 10
Let A = {all words in the English language}

Let two words be "equivalent" if they begin with the same letter.

> Is it an equivalence? Confirm. Yes.

> Find equivalence class of the word "quiet"

The set of all words that start with Q
