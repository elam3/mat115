### Doing more examples of direct proofs

**Example: Prove: If N is a positive integer, then N^3-N is even.**

**Proof:**

Assume N is a positive integer

then N is either even or odd.

**Case1:** N even

if N is even then N = 2k, where k is an integer

so, N^3-N = (2k)^3 - 2k

= 8k^3 - 2k
= 2[4k^3 - k]

thus N^3 - N is even

**Case2:** N odd 

If N is odd, there exists an integer k

such that N = 2k+1

therefore N^3-N = (2k+1)^3 - (2k+1)

= 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + ~~1~~ - 2k - ~~1~~

= 2[4k^3+6k^2+3k]

thus N^3 - N is even.

> And need to cover all cases



### Disproving Something

> One thing we didn't mention last time was how to disprove something

**Example: Disprove: Every positive integer is the sum of the squares of two integers.**

**Counterexample:**

3 is not the sum of two squares

3 = 1 + 2

> The only way to write 3 as a sum of two positive integers is 1 + 2

> But 2 is not a perfect square

### Proof by Contrapositive

**Example: Prove: If n^3+5 is odd, then n is even.**

> We could try to do an indirect proof, it might be possible. But easier by contrapositive.

> When direct proof gets to a dead end, we're forced to do other ways like contrapositive, contradiction...

**Proof by Contrapositive:**


Assume n is odd

then there exists an integer k

such that n = 2k+1

so, n^3+5 = 8k^3+12k^2+6k+1+5

= 2(4k^3+6k^2+3k+2)


Contrapositive Statement: If n is odd, then n^3+5 is even.

Hence n^3 + 5 is even.

**Direct Proof:**

Assue n^3+5 is odd

then there exists an integer k

so that n^3 + 5 = 2k + 1

therefore n^3 = 2k-4 = 2(k-2)

```
thus, n^3 is even

...

n is even
```

> ... how do we get to the statement, "n is even"

> sneak in a little contrapositive proof in between

n odd => n=2k + 1

=> n^3 = (2k+1)^3

= 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1

= 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k) + 1

so n^3 is odd

### More proofs by contradiction

> Proof by contradiction might be the one that's harder to get used to.

**Example: Prove: sqrt(2) is rational**

IF r is the square root of 2, then r is irrational

**Proof by Contradiction:**

Assume r is the square root of 2 and r is rational

r rational means there exists integers a and b so that

r = a/b and a/b is lowest terms.

but r equals to sqrt(2) means that r^2 = 2

so, (a/b)^2 = 2

this implies that a^2 = 2b^2

so a^2 is even, thus a is even

therefore there exists an integer k so that a = 2k

thus a^2 = 4k^2

therefore 4k^2 = 2b^2 => 2k^2 = b^2 => b^2 is even => b is even

So, there exists an integer L

so that b=2L

thus a/b = ( ~~2~~ k )/( ~~2~~ L) = k/L


**Example: Prove: If integer n is the sum of the squares of two odd integers, then n is not a perfect square.**

**Proof by contradiction**

> If we're doing by contradiction, start by assume IF part

Assume integer n is the sume of the square of two odd integers

> and we assume the negation of the THEN part

and n is a perfect square

> Now we begin,

We know that the square of an odd integer is odd

> odd * odd = odd

therefore, n = sum of squares of two odd integers

implies that n = odd + odd = even

~~thus n^2 is even * even~~

> which is not only even, but is divisible by 4

~~thus, there exists an integer k so that~~

~~n = 2k, hence n^2 = 4k^2~~

so, if n = p^2 for some integer p, then p is even

so p = 2k for some integer k.

therefore n = (2k)^2 = 4k^2

so, n = sum of squares of two odd integers means there

exists integer L and M such that

(2L + 1)^2 + (2M + 1)^2 = 4k^2

=> 4L^2 + 4L + 1 + 4M^2 + 4M + 1 = 4k^2

=> 2 = 4(k^2-L^2-L-M^2-M)

=> 4 is a factor of 2

> nonsense, 4 cannot be a factor of 2

this ia contradiction

**One more Proof by Contradiction Example**
**Example: Prove: There are infinitely many primes.**

**Proof by Contradiction:**

> Assume the opposite

Assume there are only finitely many primes.

Then we can list them: `p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n`

consider the number M = `p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n` + 1

Note that M can't be an list since M > P_i for all i.

thus M is composite. So there xists some prime P_k

on the list with:

M = P_k * N for N = integer

so p_1 * p_2 * ... P_k * P_n + 1 = P_k * N

there 1 = P_k * N - P_1 * P_2 * ... * P_k * P_n

= P_k * [ N - P_1 * P_2 * ... * P_k * P_n ] 

=> P_k | 1 => P_k = 1

Contradiction!
