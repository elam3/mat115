## Homework Review

### problem 1
If N is an integer, then 6 divides N^3 + 3N^2 + 2N

Told to do a **Direct Proof:**

Assume N is an integer

then N^3 + 3N^2 + 2N 

= N ( N^2 + 3N + 2 )

= N ( N + 1 ) ( N + 2 )

Note that at least oneof the integers N, N+1, N+2

is even. Thus N^3 + 3N^2 + 2N is a multiple of 2.

Also, exactly one of N, N+1, N+2

must be a multiple of 3

Since N^3 + 3N^2 + 2N is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it's a multiple of 6.

### problem 2c

At least 15 of any 99 days must be on the same day of the week.

> Maybe the question wasn't very clear. But we're trying to allocate 99 days into a set of 7 (Days of Week), and one of the days of week will have at least 15 days allocated.

Write it in a IF..THEN.. format:

> maybe do it in terms of sets

IF S is any set of 99 days,

THEN at least 15 of them are on the same day of the week.

**Contrapositive:** If no more than 14 days out of a set of days are on the same day of the week, then the set doesn'thave 99 days.

**Proof:** Assume we have no more than 14 are on teh same day of the week.

Then we have at most,

(14)(7)=98 days

### operations on sets

1. The `union` of sets A and B, denoted by "A u B", is the set of all objects that are in A `OR` in B.

  > there are two OR's, 
  * inclusive -- one or the other, can't have both
  * exclusive -- truth table looks like F T T T

2. the `intersection` of sets A and B, denoted by " A n B", is the set of all objects that are in A `AND` in B.

  **Example:**

  Suppose A = {a,b,c}, B = {b,c,d}

  A u B = {a,b,c,d}

  A n B = {b,c,}

3. the `complement` of sets A, denoted by `A'`, is the set of all objects that are `NOT` in A.
    
  > Can also be denoted by a bar on top. Diff books do it different. Some even say A^c to say the complement of A.

  > how do you know what's in the set that is not in A?

  > you can say... A' = { the chalk, that guy's shoe, the clock...it goes on...}

  > that's absurd. need to know the context

  > to the know the "universe of discourse"

  > e.g. U = {a,b,c,d,e,f,g} = "universe of discourse"

  > so if A = {a,b,c,}

  > then A' = {d,e,f,g}

**Note 1:** If A and B are any sets,

then A c= A u B and B c= A u B

**Note 2:** If A and B are sets,

then A n B c= A and A n B c= B

> We can visualize the sets, through a Venn Diagram

> ![Venn Diagram](http://www.clipartbest.com/cliparts/nTB/G6r/nTBG6rkrc.png)

**Definition:** Sets A and B are said to be `disjoint` if A n B = 0, the empty set {}.

**Definition:** Suppose A is any set 

and A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n is

a collection of subsets of A.

we say this collection is a **partition** of A

if the union A_1 u A_2 u A_3 ... u A_n = A, and A_i n A_j = 0, for i!=j.

### Rules of Set Algebra

1. `Commutativity`

  A u B = B u A

  A n B = B n A

2. `Associativity`

  A u (B u C) = (AuB) u C

  A n (B n C) = (AnB) n C

3. `Distributivity`

  A n (B u C) = (A n B) u (A n C)

  A u (B n C) = (A u B) n (A u C)

  > normally in algebra, distributivity is only one rule

  > not two, like we have here

  > but let's prove it

  > using venn diagram,

  > `a u (b n c)` is A filled in, and (b n c) filled in

  > `(a u b) n (a u c)` is where it's all filled in

  > but this is not a formal proof

  > So let's do that,

  **Formal Proof** (by Inclusion Argument)

  > start by assume the following

  Assume x ∈ A u (B n C)

  then x∈A or x∈BnC

  => x∈A or x∈B and x∈C

  if x∈A, then x∈AuB and x∈AuC

  so, x∈(AuB)n(AuC)

  if x∈B and x∈C, then x∈AuB and x∈AuC

  so, x∈(AuB)  (AuC)

  in either case, x∈Au(BnC) => x∈(AuB)n(AuC)

  since x was arbitrary, this shows that
  
  Au(BnC)c=(AuB)n(AuC)

  similarly, suppose x∈(AuB)n(AuC)

  then x∈AuB and x∈AuC

  so x∈A or X∈B and x∈A or x∈C

  if x∈A, then x∈Au(BnC)

  if x!∈A, then x∈B and x∈C, so x∈BnC => x∈Au(BnC)

  in any case, x∈(AuB)n(AuC) => x∈Au(BnC). since x was arbitrary

  this shows that (AuB)n(AuC)c=Au(BnC)

  since Au(BnC)c=(AuB)n(AuC)

  and (AuB)n(Auc)c=Au(BnC)

  it follows that

  Au(BnC) = (AuB)n(AuC)

  > so tedious

4. `Identity Laws`

  A u 0 = A

  A n U = A  `// U, is the universe`

5. `Complementation Property`

  A u A' = U

  A n A' = 0

6. `Idempotency Laws`

  A u A = A

  A n A = A

7. `DeMorgan Laws`

  (AuB)' = A' n B'

  (AnB)' = A' u B'


**Definition:** The `difference` of two sets A and B, denoted by `A - B`, is the set of all objects that are in A but **not** in B.

  Note: ` A - B = A n B' `


**Definition:** The `Cartesian Product` of sets A and B,

denoted by "A x B", reads "a cross b", is the set of all

ordered pairs (a,b) where a∈A and b∈B.

  **Example:** If A = {a,b,c}, and B = {1,2}

  then A x B = {(a,1), (a,2), (b,1), (b,2), (c,1), (c,2)}

  B x A = {(1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,a), (2,b), (2,c)}

  Note that AxB!=BxA

  BxB = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}

  Note that RxR = set of ordered pairs of real numbers

  i.e. the coordinate plane ("cartesian plane")

  The Cartesian Product of

  the sets A_1< A_2, ..., A_n

  is the set ordered n-tuples

  of elements from A_1, ..., A_n

  we denote this by A_x x A_x x ... x A_n

**Example:** Let A = {a,b,c}, B={1,2}, C={sqr,tri}

    A x B x C = { (a,1,sqr), (a,1,tri), (a,2,sqr), a,2,tri),

                (b,1,sqr), (b,1,tri), (b,2,sqr), (b,2,tri),

                (c,1,sqr), (c,1,tr), (c,2,sqr), (c,2,tr) }

If we indicate the number of elements of sets s by |s|,

then | A_1 x A_2 x ... x A_n | = |A_1| * |A_2| * ... * |A_n|
