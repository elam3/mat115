## Examples
How many ways are there to permute the elements of the set {A,B,C,D,E} so that A comes before B?

> Thea idea is: There is a 1-1 correspondence between the permutations with

> A before B and the permutations with B before A.

How many permutations are there? `5!`

So there are 5!/2 = 60 ways

## Example

A secretary lives 7 blocks west and 9 blocks south of the office she works at.

Everyday she walks exactly 16 blocks to work. How many distinct routes can

she choose?

> Could draw a grid

> And treat each corner of the block as 2 decisions, walk east or north

> Problem is: can hit the edge of the grid, and no longer have 2 choices


> **Alternatively:** We can draw a graph...

> but we end up with 2<sup>16</sup> (65,568) endpoints


> **Giving Directions:** What if you want to tell someone your path. How would

> that be done? One possible way would be to give the sequence of U's and O's

> `U` for `Up`, and `O` for `Over`. 

> In this model, it's a sequence of 16 directions, and 7 of them have to be 

> `O` and 9 of them have to be `U`. So 16 choose 9

OUUOUUUOUUOUUOOO

7 O's, 9 U's

C(16,9) = (16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10)/(7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)

= 80(143) = 11,440

## Example

A shop sells 8 kinds of doughnuts. How many orders of 5 doughnuts are possible at this shop?

> It may be tempting to say that, Oh! 8 choose 5.

> What is C(8,5)? = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5)/(3!5!) = 56

5 of one kind -> 8

4 of a kind, 1 of a kind => 56

3 of one, 2 of another -> 56

3,1,1, -> 8 * C(7,2) = 168

> Note: the ordering of the kind is important

2,2,1 -> C(8,2) * 6 = 28 * 6 = 168

2,1,1,1 -> 8 * C(7,3) = 8 * 35 = 280 = 5 * 56

1,1,1,1,1 -> C(8,5) = 56

= 14 * 56 + the initial 8 = `792`

### Alternative method, using box principle

sequence of 5 0's and 7 1's:

= C(12,7) = 792

## Example

In how many ways can 7 baseballs and 6 bats be distributed among 4 children

so that each child receives at least one ball?

> Try using multiplication principle:

S<sub>1</sub>: distribute balls : N<sub>1</sub> = C(6,3) = 20

S<sub>2</sub>: distribute bats : N<sub>2</sub> = C(9,3) = 84

20(84) = 1680

## Example

How many ways to distribute 6 cookies to 4 children.

```
( n + k - 1 )    ( 9 )   ( n + k - 1 )
(           )  = (   ) = (           ) 
(   ____    )    ( 6 )   (     n     )

                 ( 9 )   ( n + k - 1 )
               = (   ) = (           )
                 ( 3 )   (   k - 1   )

```

> Which one is the `n`, which one is the `k`?

> Note the distiguishable, and indistinguishable

The cookies are `in`distinguishable

and the children ARE distinguishable

```
                Cookies

    |        |          |         |
    V        V          V         V

        |          |         |
----------------------------------------
                Boxes
```


## Example

A box contains 12 crayons, each a diferent color. In how many distinct

ways can they be distributed to 3 children so that each child receives 4

crayons?

C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>2</sub> C<sub>3</sub> ... C<sub>12</sub>

or C(12,4) * C(8,4) * C(4,4)

```
   12!
--------  =   ... 34,650
  4!4!4!
```

## Example

How many fuctions f:A->B are 1-1 if |A|=8 & |B|=5?

None! (by the box principle: one of the boxes will have 2+ things in it)

## Example

At least how many people need to be at a gathering to insure that at least

5 of them were born on the same month?

By the PHP, we need N so that &lceil;<sub>N/12</sub>&rceil; = 5

=> 4 < N/12 <= 5

=> N > 48

=> smallest N is `49`

## Example

Let S be a set of 5 distinct points (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>)

with integer coordinates in the xy plane.

Show that the midpoint of the line joining at least one pair of these

points has integer coefficients.

> What is  midpoint?

(x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>), (x<sub>j</sub>,y<sub>j</sub>)

midpoint = ((x<sub>i</sub>+x<sub>j</sub>)/2, (y<sub>i</sub>+y<sub>j</sub>/2))

> When is the midpoint an integer? the sum must be even number?

boxes (odd,odd)
(odd,even)
(even,odd)
(even,even)

there is at least one "box" that contains at least 2 points (x,y) and (x,y)


## Example

Durin a month iwht 30 days, a baseball team plays at least one game per 

day, but no more than 45 games.

Show that there must be a period of some number of consecutive days during 

which the team played exactly 14 games.


**Proof:**

Consider

a<sub>1</sub> < a<sub>2</sub> < a<sub>3</sub> < ... a<sub>30</sub>

where a<sub>i</sub> = no. of games played after i days

Note that the a<sub>i</sub> are **distinct**.

Consider also the numbers

a<sub>1</sub>+14 < a<sub>2</sub>+14 < a<sub>3</sub>+14 < ... a<sub>30</sub>+14

these are 30 **distinct** no's.

together we have 60 numbers

all are integers from 1 to 59.

At least two are equal

So, ther msu be some i and j

so that a<sub>j</sub> = a<sub>i</sub> + 14

therefore, days i+1,i+2,...ij

is a sequence of consecutive days 

in which exactly 14 ames was played.
